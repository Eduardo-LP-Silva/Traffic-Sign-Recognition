# Traffic Sign Recognition
Application designed to detect and classify traffic signs by their color (blue or red) and shape (squared, triangular or circular). The main process is based on image color segmentation and contour finding / discriminating.

## Usage

Make sure you have [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html) installed.
Run the main file:

```bash
python main.py
```

Provide an image with a traffic sign (or multiple) and see the outcome.
